The Birth of the Turing Machine
Alan Turing doesn’t build a robot. He builds an idea. A hypothetical machine — which we now call the Turing Machine — that could simulate any algorithm you can think of, given enough time and tape.

Think of it like this: if you can explain the rules clearly enough, this “machine” can follow them blindly and produce the answer.

It was like inventing the brain… without the neurons.

Fast Forward to 1950: “Can Machines Think?”
In 1950, Turing writes a paper with the boldest question of his time:
“Can machines think?”

To answer that, he proposes a test — later called the Turing Test — where if a machine can fool a human into thinking it’s also human, we must admit it has some form of intelligence.

This moment is now seen as the starting pistol for Artificial Intelligence.

Spoiler alert: Machines didn’t pass that test then.
But they’re getting really close now.

Enter: The First Learning Machine (1957)
Fast forward a few more years.

A psychologist named Frank Rosenblatt creates the Perceptron — the first algorithm that could learn from data.

It was simple, crude, and limited.
But it was a machine that could improve itself.
That was enough to make the scientific world think.

Headlines declared:

Perceptron could walk, talk, and learn like a baby!

Okay… it was oversold. It flopped.
But it planted a seed. And seeds grow.

1980s: The Quiet Comeback
The world moves on. AI becomes a punchline in computer science. Funding dries up.

But in dusty labs and stubborn minds, the idea of machine learning refuses to die.

In 1986, researchers bring back neural networks — inspired by how our brain works — and this time, the models can finally do something useful. Like recognizing handwriting. Or predicting data trends.

Still early. Still basic.

But the machines were learning again.

1997: Game Over, Humans
In 1997, IBM's Deep Blue defeats world chess champion Garry Kasparov.

Let that sink in:
A computer beat the best human in the world… in chess.
And not by brute force alone — but by learning and optimizing strategies.

Suddenly, “Can machines think?” becomes less of a joke and more of a warning.

We’d entered the Machine Learning era.

But How Do Machines Learn?
That’s the million-dollar question, right?

Not all machines learn the same way.

Some learn like students, from labeled examples — we call this Supervised Learning.

Some are explorers, figuring things out without answers — Unsupervised Learning.

And some are more like gamers, trial-and-error addicts, learning from wins and losses — Reinforcement Learning.

That’s what we’ll explore next.

But remember: It all started with a question in a quiet room in 1936.

A question that hasn’t been fully answered yet.

Can machines think?
