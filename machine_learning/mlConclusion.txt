Which ML Technique to choose
Which one to use when?
Alright, we’ve met all three machine learning styles.

Now imagine this is a reality show.

You’re the host.
A problem shows up.
Three contestants - Supervised, Unsupervised, and Reinforcement - raise their hands.

But only one gets to solve it.

So let’s figure out:
Who learns what? And when?

Round 1: Recognizing the Animals
Problem: You have 10,000 images of animals. Each one is labeled as "cat" or "dog".

Who’s raising their hand?

Supervised Learning stands up.

“Give me the answers, and I’ll learn the pattern.”

That’s what it’s built for - labeled data and clear goals.

Round 2: Recognizing the Crowd
Problem: You have customer data, but no labels. You don’t know who buys what or why. You just have behavior logs.

Who’s up now?

Unsupervised Learning says, "I got this." “I’ll find patterns in the data without needing labels.”

It starts grouping people based on what they do - even if you didn’t ask it to.

It’s the curious explorer of the group.

Round 3: The Game Player
Problem: You need to train a robot to walk. Or teach a car to drive. Or beat someone in chess.

Who steps up?

Reinforcement Learning smirks and says:
"Let me try. I’ll figure it out after a few thousand mistakes."

It thrives where actions have consequences - and learning comes from experience.

Cheat Sheet
Learning Type	Learns From	Example Task
Supervised	Labeled data	Email spam filter
Unsupervised	Unlabeled data	Customer segmentation
Reinforcement	Trial and error	Self-driving car, video games
Quick Quiz - Who Would You Call?
Predict tomorrow’s weather based on past labeled data?
→ Supervised

Discover hidden groups in social media users?
→ Unsupervised

Train a drone to land smoothly on a platform?
→ Reinforcement

Classify X-rays as healthy or not?
→ Supervised

Conclusion
All three learning styles are useful.
None is better than the others.
It depends on the problem.

Think of them like characters in a team:

Supervised is the student with notes
Unsupervised is the detective with no clues
Reinforcement is the gamer who never gives up
Together, they form the core of machine learning.
