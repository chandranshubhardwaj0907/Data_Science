Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence that enables systems to learn from data without explicit programming. It improves over time as it gains more data.

Types of ML:
Supervised Learning
Unsupervised Learning
Reinforcement Learning

Applications of Machine Learning:
Make robots recognize faces or learn to walk
Discover patterns in user logs, financial data, etc.
Segment customers for personalized marketing
Recommend products based on user behavior
Detect fraudulent transactions
Forecast sales and demand
Automate and optimize real-world decisions

Common Machine Learning Libraries:
Scikit-Learn – Ideal for regression, classification, clustering 
TensorFlow – Google’s library for large-scale ML
Keras – High-level deep learning API (comes with TensorFlow)
PyTorch – Facebook’s deep learning framework
Pandas / NumPy – Data cleaning and handling tools

PyTorch vs TensorFlow:
Both are popular frameworks for deep learning
TensorFlow offers more production deployment tools
PyTorch is often preferred for its ease of use and debugging capabilities
